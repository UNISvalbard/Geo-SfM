## 3D model reconstruction with Agisoft Metashape

````{admonition} Creating high-quality models the USGS way
:class: suggestion

The United States Geological Survey {cite}`overProcessingCoastalImagery2021` has put together an excellent tutorial on the use of Agisoft Metashape for creating high resolution digital elevation models.
Although digital elevation models are but one of many desired products, the same guide can be used for the creation of high resolution and properly processed DOMs.
USGS guidelines and the quick start guide to processing (Table 1) can be found [here](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2021/1039/ofr20211039.pdf), and should be used supplementary to this tutorial.
```
https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2021/1039/ofr20211039.pdf
```
````

In this session we will learn how to use Agisoft Metashape.
This is an established SfM photogrammetry package and is often used in the Arctic Geology department at UNIS to create digital outcrop models (DOMs) and hand-sample models (HSMs).
This session introduce basic processing through the graphical user interface through use of a standardised data set.

```{admonition} Software version
The following tutorial assumes the use of **Agisoft Metashape version 2.x.x.**
Note that versions 1.6.x-1.8.x are very similar, and can use the same tutorials (though the interface and pop-up menus may be slightly different).

To see whether you are indeed running the correct version proceed to *Help/About Metashape...* in the menu bar.
This should provide you with the **major release**, *minor*, and patch (**2**.*0*.x) version number, as well as the build.

If the version does not match the version listed above, please either
- update the installation; or
- contact the Seismic Lab software responsible (Peter Betlem)
```

```{admonition} Think before doing...
:class: warning
Always remember that quality comes at a cost, in this case as a computational cost (i.e., time) and storage cost (i.e., size).

In processing this is the key dilemma, and requires you to think about the output before you start.

*Is it really necessary to generate a 500 GB model for a 1 by 1 square metre area, considering that your max upload limit for an assignment is only 200 MB?*
```

```{admonition} Further reading
:class: tip
The guidelines below are based on the official Agisoft *3D model reconstruction* tutorial.

### A standardised project environment

We will be using a standardised project environment throughout this course.
It is recommended to use this setup (or something similar) throughout all future projects as well.
The use of this standardised project setup is furthermore a requirement for digital models to be uploaded to [the Svalbox DB](http://svalbox.no).

Proceed by creating the following project_directory in the folder where you have all your projects..
Herein folders are named without extensions, and filenames are given extensions.
Text between {} indicates variable names.

`````{tab-set}

```
````
`````

The standardised project structures (as we will see later on) are important for automated processing and archiving.
The project structures are identical in principle, only differing in the way images are sorted.

### Photo set

Having created the standardised project structure, proceed with extracting your taken images to the following directory:


`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} Single folder/acquisition
```
{project_directory}\data\100MEDIA
```
````

````{tab-item} Single acquisition with 1000 images
```
{project_directory}\data\100MEDIA (includes up to 999 images)
{project_directory}\data\101MEDIA (includes remaining images)
```
````

````{tab-item} UAV acquisition with 3 flights
```
{project_directory}\data\f0001
{project_directory}\data\f0002
{project_directory}\data\f0003
```
````
`````

In case the image count exceeds 999 images, make sure to utilise multiple folders in the *data_directory*.
While you are at it, why not sort the images by flight or acquisition to improve your data structure?
For instance, those [digitising hand-sized samples](../l4/hsstutorial "hss_tutorial"), or who have acquired data over multiple UAV flights, may find it beneficial to sort the data in specific ways.
Not only is it easier to find the data that way, but it also prevents accidental data-overwrites of data with non-unique filenames!

````{admonition} Want to follow along without your own data?
:class: suggestion

Go ahead and download the package, then extract the archive's contents as per the above.

```
URL:
```

````

### Adding photos

Next we'll be adding the photos to Agisoft Metashape.
This assumes
To do this, proceed to and click on *Add photos...* from *Workflow* in the *menu bar*.
In the dialog that pops up, browse to the *project_directory/100MEDIA* folder that you created in the previous section.
Select all files to be processed.
These should now show up in a *chunk* with *cameras* in the *Workspace* panel.
Verify that this is indeed the case by double clicking one of the *cameras* in the *Workspace/Chunk/Cameras* panel.

```{admonition} Save often!
:class: tip
It is important to save your work often.
Make a habit of saving at least after every step.
To do so, proceed to *Save as...* under *File* in the menu bar, and save your project in the *project_directory/metashape* directory that you created when extracting in data.
```

### Python console and sorting your project data

As you may have noticed while adding your images, most cameras only allow for 999 unique file names (e.g., DJI001-DJI999).
When hundreds of files are added to a single project, this can quickly become confusing.
After all, did file DJI007 originate from flight 1 or from flight 2?
It is thus important to store files in different subfolders (as previously described), but also to have those subfolders available within the processing project in Metashape.
An easy way to do this is shown in {numref}`group_images`.
Right click the *Images* tab within the workspace, then click on *Add Camera Group*.
Then select all cameras that belong to the same acquisition or flight and drag them into the new  *Camera Group*.

```{figure} assets/group-images.gif
:name: group_images

Creating image groups and sorting the input data of the project.
```

Alternatively, as we will see in [Session 4](../l3/overview "automation"), we can automate most aspects of the workflow either by using [Batch processing](../l3/Batch "Batchautomation") or by using [the Metashape API](../l3/Batch "Batchautomation").
We here provide an example of how to use the Metashape API to quickly rename all photos within the project to reflect the data subdirectory they are in.

Proceed to the *Console* panel.
If you cannot find it, go to the main menu bar, select *View* and click *Console* to activate it.
This opens the terminal, and allows you to interact with the project through Python.

```{figure} assets/console_view.png
:name: console_view

View of the Python console in Metashape.
```

Paste in the following script and see what happens with the labels of your files:

```
import Metashape # imports the metashape functions/library
from pathlib import Path # imports the Path function from the pathlib library

doc = Metashape.app.document # accesses the current workspace and document
chunk = doc.chunk # makes a quicklink variable to the active chunk in the document

for c in chunk.cameras: # loops over all cameras in the active chunk
    cp = Path(c.photo.path) # gets the photo path on the harddrive for each photo
    c.label = str(cp.parent.name) + '/' + cp.name # renames the camera label in the metashape workspace to reflect the parent directory of the photo
```

### Analyze photos

Before actual processing begins, we need to analyse the imported photos.
This is done by right clicking any of the photos in a *Chunk*, then selecting *Estimate Image Quality...*, and select all photos to be analysed, as shown in {numref}`analyze_process`.

```{figure} assets/analyze_process.gif
:name: analyze_process

Estimating image quality in the Metashape GUI.
```

One can then open the *Photos* pane by clicking *Photos* in the *View* menu.
Then, make sure to view the details rather than icons to check the Quality for each image ({numref}`analyze_select`.)

```{figure} assets/analyze_select.gif
:name: analyze_select

Showing the image quality and disable photos that do not meet the requirement in the Metashape GUI.
```

Then, filter on quality and *Disable* all selected cameras that do not meet the standard.
Agisoft recommends a *Quality* of at least 0.5.

### Aligning photos

With the photos now imported into Metashape and analysed, we can proceed with the alignment process.
This process goes through all images in the project and tries to identify *common features*.
In Metashape this first requires the estimation of camera positions for each photo, which are then used to build a *sparse cloud*.
Select *Align Photos...* in the *Workflow* menu.

A {ref}`dialog <align_photos>` will pop up with several parameter options.
Most important here is the *Accuracy* parameter, which governs whether your photos are down-sampled before alignment.

For now we'll skip the other parameters; just make sure to deselect *Reference preselection*, *Guided image matching*, and *Adaptive camera model fitting*.
Keep *Generic preselection* and *Exclude stationary tie points* selected.

After clicking *OK*, Metashape starts aligning your photos.
This may take a while, but assuming there is sufficient overlap between the data, a *sparse point cloud* will be shown on the screen (in the *Model* tab) once processing is done.
If not, one can select this by clicking the four-dotted icon in the menu.

```{figure} assets/3a24665c.png
:name: align_photos

The *Align Photos* dialog after opening it from the *Workflow* menu.
```

```{admonition} Down-sampling
Down-sampling is the process in which you combine parts of a data set, resulting in the loss of knowledge.
For example, down-sampling a 1000x1000 pixel image to a 100x100 image results in a factor 100 compression of data (= easier to process), but you also lose the initial resolution!

Depending on your computer specifications, you'll have to weigh computational time versus output quality.

Give it a shot, and compare the photo alignment results with *medium* vs *high* processing accuracy.
```

(content-tutorial-improve)=
### Improve alignment step: Error Reduction-Optimization and Camera Calibration


```{admonition} Ground control points
:class: warning
Additional steps are needed to ensure ground control points and checkpoints are adequately integrated into the model.
We will discuss what ground control points are and what they can be used for in [](content:gcps).

Those implementing ground control points, please refer to the USGS manual for the correct sequence of steps and optimizations.
```

Although the photos have now been aligned, it is important to further optimize the cameras.
This is done by selecting *Optimize Cameras* from the *Tools* menu.
A {ref}`dialog <optimize_cameras>` will pop up with several parameter options pre-selected.
Most important here is to at least select make sure that the *Estimate tie point covariance* is enabled.

```{figure} assets/291baf87.png
:name: optimize_cameras

The *Optimize Camera Alignment* dialog after opening it from the *Tools* menu.
Make sure to enable *Fit f*, *Fit k1-k3*, *Fit cx, cy*, *Fit p1-p2*, and *Estimate tie point covariance*.
```

Once processing is done, change the model view to show the Point Cloud Variance by following the instructions given in {ref}`dialog <point-cloud-variance>`.
Lower values (=blue) are generally better and more constrained.

```{figure} assets/view_tie_point_covariance.gif
:name: point-cloud-variance

Changing the view of your points and model to show errors and other things.
Here we change our view to show Spare Point Covariance instead of RGB coloring.
```

As the sparse cloud is the very first step in a long processing chain, we want to optimize it as much as possible.
After all, bad quality in usually equals bad quality out.
We will now conduct several optimizations to improve quality of the sparse cloud, implementing USGS {cite}`overProcessingCoastalImagery2021` recommendations that aim to reduce reconstruction uncertainty, improve projection accuracy, and lower the overall reprojection errors.
Unlike shown below, the project sometimes benefits by having each of the steps repeated multiple times, rather than just once.
Keep in mind, however, that running too many optimizations may also result in over-fitting of the data.
That means that the model is no longer based on real input, but rather on the processing parameters (= not real!).

````{admonition} Make a backup for every step
:class: tip
Whenever you are about to perform a destructive action (i.e., "deleting" stuff), make sure to make a backup of the current state first.
In Metashape this can be done by right clicking an object (e.g., Chunk, Points, etc.) and selecting the *Duplicate...* option.
It usually takes a bit of time to complete, but the cost of not doing so is usually much, much higher!

```{figure} assets/duplicate_chunk.gif
:name: duplication

Making a backup duplicate of Chunk 1. To keep things simple, make sure to rename your copies; else you may end up with a Copy of Copy of Copy of Something...
```
````

```{admonition} Use Python scripting 
:class: tip

The following subsections may be automated through use of the built-in consol and Python code available through the [Python snippets section](../suppl/python-snippets "tutorial").
```

#### Filtering by Reconstruction Uncertainty

Once you're ready (ahem, make a duplicate/backup first!), filter your Sparse points by their Reconstruction Uncertainty.

```{figure} assets/reconstruction_uncertainty_filter.gif
:name: filter_reconstruction_uncertainty

The *Gradual Selection* dialog after opening it from the *Model* menu, here showing selections that are possible for the Sparse Point Cloud.
A good value to use here is 10, though make sure you do not remove all points by doing so!
After clicking OK, the left corner shows you how many points there are in total, followed by the number currently selected.
A rule of thumb is to select no more than two-thirds to half of all points, and then delete these by pressing the Delete key on the keyboard.
```

After deleting the selected points, it is important to once more optimize the alignment of your points.
Do so by revisiting the [](content-tutorial-improve) section.

#### Filtering by Projection accuracy

This time, select the points based on their Projection accuracy, aiming for a final Projection accuracy of 3.

```{figure} assets/f7c6c589.png
:name: filter_projection_error

The *Gradual Selection* dialog after opening it from the *Model* menu, here making a selection based on the projection accuracy parameter.
A good value to use here is 3, though make sure you do not remove all points by doing so!
After clicking OK, the left corner shows you how many points there are in total, followed by the number currently selected.
```

Keep in mind that not all projects can tolerate the removal of points below 5, which is no problem as long as you document the values you have used.
After deleting the selected points, it is important to once more optimize the alignment of your points.
Do so by revisiting the [](content-tutorial-improve) section.

#### Filtering by Reprojection Error

Up next is to filter the points by their reprojection error, see {ref}`dialog <filter_reprojection_error>`.
A good value to use here is 0.3, though make sure you do not remove all points by doing so!
As a rule of thumb, this final selection of points should leave you with approx. 10% of the points you started off with.

```{figure} assets/5fba8b6a.png
:name: filter_reprojection_error

The *Gradual Selection* dialog after opening it from the *Model* menu, here making a selection based on the reprojection error parameter.
After clicking OK, the left corner shows you how many points there are in total, followed by the number currently selected.
```

After deleting the selected points, it is important to runa final *Optimize alignment* step on your points.
Do so by revisiting the [](content-tutorial-improve) section.

```{admonition} Keep your duplicates
:class: tip

It is always a good idea to keep your duplicate backups of previous steps until you are fully done with them.
They allow you to go back and write down important processing parameters, such as how many points were filtered during each step and which cutoff values you used during processing.
Only once completely done should you remove these earlier attempts.
```

### Build Point Cloud

Based on the estimated camera positions, we can now estimate a *dense point cloud* by calculating depth information for each image.

Select *Build Point Cloud* from the *Workflow* menu.
{ref}`Once again you will be asked about the desired accuracy/quality <dense_cloud>`.
Keeping in mind what we discussed above, make sure to select *Medium* for the quality.

Also open up the *Advanced* section, and set *Depth filtering* to *Mild*.
**Make sure to always enable *Calculate point confidence***

*Reuse depth maps* can only be selected if depth maps have been previously calculated for the specified quality.

```{figure} assets/d2a861b0.png
:name: dense_cloud

The *Build Point Cloud* dialog after opening it from the *Workflow* menu. Reuse depth maps when avaialable. Always toggle Calculate Point Confidence.
```

Once processing is done, you'll be able to show the *dense point cloud* on the screen in the *Model* tab.
If not, one can visualise the *dense point cloud* by clicking on the nine-dotted icon in the menu.
Alternative, you could also visualise the point confidence.
Do so by clicking the gray triangle next to the nine-dotted icon and selecting *Point Cloud confidence*.
The colour coding (red = bad, blue = good) shows where the best confidence is found.

```{admonition} Point confidence
*Point confidence* shows how accurate a given point in the Point Cloud is.
This is key to estimate whether the part we are interested in can be scientifically used for measurements and characterisation based on predefined criteria.
```

```{admonition} Point Cloud quality
:class: tip
While this tutorial suggests *Medium* to be used for the quality parameter, you should feel free to change this depending on the computational power at your disposal.
```

#### Selection by point confidence

```{admonition} Save time - make backups
:class: tip
Make sure to always either backup your data before playing with it.
This can be done by either backing up the entire project (*Save as...*) or by making a local copy of the data within the project.
To do the latter, right click on the *Workspace/Point Cloud (... points)* and select *Duplicate...*.
Following alterations to the duplicated data set, you can always switch back to the original by right clicking *Workspace/Point Cloud (... points)* and *Set As Default*.
```

There are various ways of cutting off parts of your Point Cloud.
However, not all of them are scientifically repeatable - because let's be honest, would you be able to exactly tell which of the points you removed from the data? No.

Luckily, Metashape allows selection and deletion of points by *Point confidence*.
Proceed to *Tools/Point Cloud* in the menu and click on *Filter by confidence...*.
The dialog that pops up allows you to set minimal and maximal confidences.

For example, try setting *Min*:50 and *Max*:255 to only show the Point Cloud points wth the highest confidence.
After looking at the difference, reset the filter by clicking on *Reset filter* within the *Tools/Point Cloud* menu.

We will now use the method outlined above to filter out the lowest confidence interval (in this case, set *Min*:0 and *Max*:5).
Proceed by selecting all the points shown in the *Model* tab.
Do this by enabling the *Rectangle Selection* tool, found next to the mouse pointer icon in the menu.
Then drag a rectangle selection and include all to-be-selected points currently visible.
Delete the selected points by hitting the *Del(ete)* key on the keyboard.

Now reset the filter, and you'll see that just the high-confidence part remains. :)

```{admonition} Scientific repeatability
**Always write down the chosen confidence interval** - repeatability depends on it!
```

### Building a model

We can use the point cloud to generate a polygonal model.
While generating the Point Cloud, Agisoft Metashape simultaneously generated a set of depth maps (if chosen to save to the project).
This is important as we can decide which of the two to use for building the model.
Depth maps may lead to better results when dealing with a big number of minor details, but otherwise Point Clouds should be used as the source.

After selecting *Build Model* from the *Workflow* menu, you will be able to chose either in the {ref}`dialog <build_model>` that pops up for *Source data:*.

```{figure} assets/9b4ac0b8.png
:name: build_model

The *Build model* dialog after opening it from the *Workflow* menu.
```

Other important parameters here are the *Quality* and *Face count* parameters.
These govern the quality of the generated model.
Remember, however, that quality comes at a cost, so best to stick to *Medium* or lower to manage the exercise within the allocated of time...

Finally, feel free to enable the *Calculate vertext colors* to provide the model with some colour as well, otherwise it will be shown as a purple model.

Once generated, we can take a closer look at the model by clicking on the *Tetrahedral* icon next to the nine-dotted icon.
Clicking on the gray triangle next to it, you see that the *Model Textured* is still grayed out.
The next step involves generating a texture and placing this "image" onto the model - after which the *Model Textured* becomes selectable.

```{admonition} Depth maps
:class: tip
If depth maps do exist, and you decide to use them as the source data, then make sure to enable *Reuse depth maps* to save computational time!
```

#### Filtering the model

Sometiems your model features blobs that are not connected to the main model.
These can be easily (and scientifically!) removed through use of the *Connected component filter*, see {ref}`dialog <filter_connected_component_size>`.

```{figure} assets/filter_connected_component_size.gif
:name: filter_connected_component_size

Filtering the model based on the connected component size.
This is a percentage of the largest component, which by default is 100.
```

```{admonition} Select the model first!
:class: warning
The option may not be available if you have not selected the model data first, or not in the model view panel.
```

#### Texture building

We can build the textures by clicking on the *Build Texture* command from the *Workflow* menu.
While the dialog has many different parameters, the most important are highlighted in {numref}`build_texture`.

```{figure} assets/7237597c.png
:name: build_texture

The *Build texture* dialog after opening it from the *Workflow* menu.
```

Here *Texture size/count* determines the quality of the texture.
Keep in mind that anything over 16384 can very quickly lead to very, very large file sizes on your harddisk.
On the other hand, anything less than 4096 is probably insufficient.
For greatest compatibility, keep the *Texture size* at 4096, but increase the count to e.g. 5 or 10.

```{admonition} Publishing on V3Geo or Sketchfab
:class: tip

Publication guidelines for V3Geo specify that the *Texture size* must always be 4096.
In addition, no fewer than 10 *Texture count* must be used.
It is recommended to follow this even for SketchFab, as this setup generally results in a higher-quality look of the published model.
```

### Generating a Tiled Model

Sometimes the need arises to not only build a model, but also a *Tiled Model*.
We can do this by selecting *Build Tiled Model* from the *Workflow* menu.
Once again we can select the parameters for the processing step through the {ref}`dialog <build_tiled_model>` that popped up.

The most import parameter here is the *Pixel size (m)*, which should never be set than lower than the pixel size available to the model (= the default value shown when opening the dialog).

```{figure} assets/6c44a1dc.png
:name: build_tiled_model

The *Build Tiled Model* dialog after opening it from the *Workflow* menu.
```

### Build Digital Elevation Model (DEM)

_Digital Elevation Model (DEM)_ represents a surface model as a regular grid of height values. Select the _Build DEM_ command from the _Workflow menu_. A dialog box will open to choose the parameters for building DEM.

To start, we need to check the _Projection type_:
- _Geographic_ : With the Geographic feature, you can select a geographic coordinate system either from the dropdown menu or enter the parameters for a customized system. It's important to specify the coordinate system used for referencing the model. When exporting the results, it will be possible to project them onto a different geographic coordinate system.
- _Planar_: You can project a DEM onto a plane of your choice. You can select the projection plane and orientation of the resulting DEM.
- _Cylindrical_: This parameter enables the projection of DEM onto a cylindrical surface. The height value is determined by measuring the distance between the model surface and the cylindrical surface.

Agisoft Metashape allows the DEM generation based on the point cloud or model. It is recommended to use _Point Cloud_ as the source data since it provides more accurate results and faster processing. You can generate elevation data results from depth maps or a tie point cloud. If you need the DEM to follow the polygonal model precisely or if the point cloud hasn't been reconstructed, you can use the Model and Tiled Model options.

We suggest keeping the interpolation parameter _Disabled_ for accurate reconstruction results since only areas corresponding to point cloud or polygonal points are reconstructed. Usually, this method is recommended for Model and Tiled Model data source.

Once the DEM generation process is complete, you can view the reconstructed model in Ortho view by clicking the _Basemap_ button on the _Toolbar_.

### Build Orthomosaic

Building and exporting an _orthomosaic_ is normally used for generation of high resolution imagery based on the source photos and reconstructed model.

```{note}
The Build Orthomosaic procedure is only possible for projects saved in .PSX format that have existing model or DEM chunks.
```

To start building and orthomosaic, select _Build Orthomosaic_ command from the _Workflow menu_.

To begin, you have to select the _Projection_ parameter. 
- _Geographic_ projectionis often used for aerial photogrammetric surveys.
- _Planar_ projection is helpful when working with models that have vertical surfaces, such as vertical digital outcrop models.
- _Cylindrical_ projection can help reduce distortions when projecting cylindrical objects like tubes, rounded towers, or tunnels.

To generate an accurate orthomosaic, we advise selecting _Model_ as the desired surface. For complete coverage, we recommend selecting the _Enable hole filling_ option under _Blending mode_ to fill in any empty areas of the mosaic.

The suggested _Pixel size (m)_ will be based on the average ground sampling resolution of the original images. Using the surface size and input pixel size, the total size of the orthomosaic (measured in pixels) will be calculated and displayed at the bottom of the dialogue box.

```{note}
You can store multiple Orthomosaic instances in a single chunk. To save the current Orthomosaic and create a new one in the same chunk, right-click on the Orthomosaic and uncheck the _Set as default_ option. If you want to save the current Orthomosaic and make a copy for editing, right-click on the Orthomosaic and select _Duplicate_.
```

Generated orthomosaic can be reviewed in _Ortho_ mode similar to the digital elevation model. It can be opened in this view mode by double-clicking on the orthomosaic label in the _Workspace_ pane.

## Documenting processing parameters

While each of the previous steps has been important in generating the models, ***perhaps the most important aspect of processing is to document the taken processing steps and their parameters***.
Metashape automatically keeps track and stores all *Workflow* actions that the project has undergone.
There are two ways of documenting and showing these parameters.

```{admonition} What about manual alterations?
:class: warning
Sadly, the processing report does not include manual changes made to e.g. the point or Point Cloud.
This means that to be truly *scientifically grounded* and *repeatable*, you should refrain from doing such alterations manually.
Instead, rely on e.g. the point confidence to make edits (and always report the chosen parameters).
```

#### Processing report

The first, and perhaps most important, is to generate a processing report.
Proceed to *File/Export* in the menu bar and select *Generate Report...*.
Provide the desired *Title* and description, then proceed by clicking *OK*.
Store the report alongside the Metashape project in the same directory.

```{note}
The procedure listed above should **always** be implemented in your workflows, with the output stored together with the raw data (e.g., images) and Metashape project files.
Make this a habit :)
```

```{admonition} Exercise 2
:class: tip
You'll find key metadata within the generated processing_report.pdf that has to be submitted as part of the second session's assignment.
Have a look and familiarise yourself with it.
```

#### In-programme parameters

One does not always need to export the processing report to obtain the overview of parameters.
Handily, Metashape also provides an overview within the *Workspace* panel after having selected an item in the chunk.
An example of this is depicted in {numref}`internal_parameters`.

```{figure} assets/5201e3e2.png
:name: internal_parameters

```

```{tip}
The above is just a very generalised approach to SfM-photogrammetry that outlines the basic steps to be taken from photo acquisition to model generation.
In many cases the chosen parameters can (and should!) be changed to match the given circumstances.
That said, the *Photo alignment* step should always be conducted at the highest setting possible (considering computational power available).
Furthermore, one should ***always document each and every processing step performed*** - manually cutting and editing part of the model is therefore *not* encouraged as this remains (for now) difficult to document.
```

### Record video

Agisoft Metashape allows the creation of a camera track. To do so you have to add viewpoints.

````{note}
To display the camera track path, select _Model_ > _Show/Hide items_ > _Show animation_.

```{figure} assets/animation.gif
:name: animation

Display the _Animation_ menu.
```
````

To create a viewpoint, first set up the scene in the Model view according to how you want it to appear in the animation. Next, click on the _Append_ button located on the _Animation_ pane to add the viewpoint to the current camera track.

If you need to change the position of the viewpoints along the camera track, simply use your left mouse button to drag the waypoints.

After creating the waypoints, you need to record the video according to the camera track you've created. To do this, click the _Capture_ button on the _Animation pane_ toolbar and choose the desired export parameters, such as video resolution, compression type, and frame rate in the _Capture Video_ dialog. Once you've made your selections, click the _OK_ button to save the video as a separate file.
