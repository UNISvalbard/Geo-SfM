# Data mining and data integration

This module covers the basic online resources to find the information you need to conduct research in Svalbard.


##Main learning objectives

This course is split in several modules, consisting of interactive lectures walkthroughs, and exercises.
The main learning objectives are:
- Familiarize and use Svalbox online portal
- Familiarize and use online resources
- Find out information 
- Present your findings to the class


##Data sets and resources

The following provides a short overview of the most relevant resources for this module (and for the entire course):
- Course material is provided on the AG222 Teams folder – use your UNIS credentials to log in.
- We have set up a course data server, accessed from the UNIS network (also via VPN), under  \\svalbox\AG222 (again, use your UNIS credentials to log in).

###Software:

####Petrel
A industry-standard subsurface software with a very steep learning tool. We will be using Petrel in the Geomodelling part as part of the Billefjorden Trough work after Easter. 
####SvalSIM
A GeoSimulator last updated in 2009 developed by Equinor as part of their inter-disciplinary Svalex student expeditions ran around Svalbard. Available for Windows on the D: drive of UNIS PCs, it can also be used on your laptops during the course.

##Exercises

Follow the tasks below at your own pace. Make screenshots of your results to document your answers/progress. We will, at regular intervals, pause and get a student to present (by sharing their screen and clicking the right buttons) how the task was achieved and what the results are.

:  These are individual exercises. However, you can work in pairs if you prefer, but each of you should deliver the exercises individually.
```{figure} assets/1_student_deliveries.png
:name: 1_student_deliveries

Deliver the exercise in the MS Teams folder.
```

###1. Virtual field trip preparation

Prepare 1 slide on the area you will be working on for your virtual field trip – where is it, how would you get there (in summer and in winter/spring) and what geological units are exposed there? 

```{figure} assets/2_student_groups_2022.png

List of names for each group.
```

###2. Using TopoSvalbard

Find and highlight the following locations using http://toposvalbard.npolar.no

```{figure} assets/3_toposvalbard.gif
:name: 3_toposvalbard

```

Mark on all locations together; then screenshot with result and paste in below.

Locations A: Festningen, Ebbadalen, Konusdalen, Agardhbukta, Kvalpynten, Farmhamna, Kapp Thordsen, Svea, Verlegenhuken, Sørkapp, Botneheia, Pyramiden, + your own Virtual Field Trip area
Locations B: Vassdalen, Blåhuken, Kvadehuken, Plurdalen, Raddedalen, Hopen, Tromsøbreen, Colesbukta, Berzeliusdalen, Grønnfjorden, Reindalspasset, Kapp Laila, Sarstangen, Petuniabukta, Adventdalen, Sysselmannbreen
: What do the locations B have in common? (hint – use Svalbox map in parallel)


###3. Using Svalbardkartet

On SvalbardKartet (http://svalbardkartet.npolar.no/html5/index.html?viewer=svalbardkartet.html5) note the following:

a. What are the units exposed between Kapp Starostin and Festiningsodden? What is their thickness? Which way is stratigraphically younger?

b. List and highlight at least five locations where you could look at the following formations. 
Wilhelmøya Subgroup
Kapp Starostin Formation
Diabasodden Suite
Helvetiafjellet Formation
Ebbadalen Formation

c. Draw a line along the Permian-Triassic boundary and export your map as a geoTiff


###4. Oblique aerial imagery

On TopoSvalbard, there are some very good old oblique area photographs. These can be used for planning field campaigns, and even to make digital models. You access them by first selecting the satellite base map, then marking on “old aerial photographs”, and clicking the arrows.

```{figure} assets/4_2_old_imagery_toposvalbard.gif
:name: 4_2_old_imagery_toposvalbard

Showing how to activate and search an old aerial photo from toposvalbard.
```

:  Here is an example of a digital model made using 10 screenshots of these images from Fuglefjellet:

```{figure} assets/5_digital_model_example.png
:name: 5_digital_model_example

Example of a digital model made using 10 screenshots of these images from Fuglefjellet.
```

a. Navigate to your field area, and include an overview of what images are available, and their overall quality (cloud cover etc.)
b. Take screenshots of a selection of 15 good quality partly overlapping images and save for future photogrammetry project


###5. ResearchInSvalbard

The RiS database is a useful portal to find out what research was done in Svalbard – as with all databases it has some issues (the major one being that there are many projects there that were never conducted for a variety of reasons), but overall it is a very useful tool to get an overview and plan your research so that you don’t do double-work. It can also help in logistical co-ordination between different field groups. Access it at https://researchinsvalbard.no/ and try to figure out the tasks below.

```{figure} assets/6_research_in_svalbard.png
:name: 6_research_in_svalbard

Example of a project search in the ResearchInSvalbard database.
```

a. Where have geologists worked on Svalbard in the summer of 2019? 
b. What about from 2005 to 2015?
c. What was the objective of the fieldwork?
d. What methods did they use?
e. Did they publish any results?
f. From which country/institute did they come?
g. List ca. 10 different campaigns in an appropriate table.


###6. Norwegian Petroleum Directorate FactMaps

The Norwegian Continental Shelf is – thanks to petroleum activity – one of the most data-rich part of the world, with thousands of exploration wells, and millions of kilometres of 2D and 3D seismic surveys.  This allows much quality geoscientific research, and also provides a framework for offshore CO2 storage (ongoing at Sleipner since 1996, Snøhvit since 2008 and Aurora starting now/Longship project). All data are owned by the companies who gather them, but become public after 2 years (raw well logs), 5 years (seismic data) and 20 years (interpretations, reports etc.). The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) manages this immense data set, and also offers useful FactPages and FactMaps to look up – see https://www.npd.no/en/ . The only downside is that while Svalbard is geologically certainly part of the Barents Shelf, politically it is not, and Svalbard exploration data (see Petroleum, coal and research drilling onshore Svalbard: a historical perspective) is not readily available.

```{figure} assets/7_1_map_npd.png
:name: 7_1_map_npd

```

```{figure} assets/7_2_factmap_npd.png
:name: 7_2_factmap_npd

NPD FactMap from the Norwegian coast with the active exploration wells.
```

####Use the NPD FactMaps to address the following tasks:
a. Where are the exploration wells? 
b. What is the northernmost well? 
c. When was the last exploration well drilled?
d. Which areas are currently licensed by oil companies? 
e. Which areas are licensed on the Russian side of the border? (hint: - see http://wwfarcticmaps.org/)
f. What are the main geological elements? 
g. What is the age of the structures?


###7. Article search and methods

Science is not about starting from scratch, but about contributing new knowledge to existing ones. You thus need to know what is the state of the art, and efficiently use referencing. UNIS has a license for EndNote reference manager which we will be using in the course. It allows automatic importing of references, and including pdfs of the references, for easy archiving.

```{figure} assets/7_1_map_npd.png
:name: 7_1_map_npd

NPD FactMap from the Norwegian coast and Svalbard.
```

a. Search for 5 relevant articles each using Google Scholar
b. Load these into your EndNote library and include the .pdf file
c. Each group to deliver a document including EndNote library of 20 articles and 3 corresponding word document with the bibliographic style of Geology, Earth-Science Reviews and Nature
d. Focus on the data and methods of each paper
- What have the researchers been doing?
- Could you reproduce their research?
- What is done well, and what could be improved in the articles?


###8. SvalSIM – the svalbard Geosimulator

a. D:\SvalSIM\ and also on Svalbox drive
b. Is there any data available for your area?
c. Make screenshots of relevant views of your study site
d. Consider using SvalSIM to “film” your journey from Longyearbyen to your field area
